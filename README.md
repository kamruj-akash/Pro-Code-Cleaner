Clean your JavaScript/TypeScript code for production with a single command!

Have you ever pushed code to production and realized you left `console.log` statements scattered everywhere? Manually cleaning up your code before a final commit can be tedious and error-prone.

**Pro-Code Cleaner** is a simple yet powerful VS Code extension designed to automate this process, ensuring your codebase is neat, clean, and production-ready.

## ‚úÖ Features

- **Remove All Console Statements:** Instantly strips out all `console` statements, including `console.log()`, `console.error()`, `console.warn()`, `console.debug()`, and `console.info()`.
- **Collapse Empty Lines:** Automatically collapses multiple empty newlines into a single empty line, improving code readability.
- **Simple & Fast:** Works with a single command, making your pre-commit cleanup process a breeze.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  Open the file you want to clean.
2.  Open the Command Palette (**`Ctrl+Shift+P`** on Windows/Linux or **`‚åò+Shift+P`** on Mac).
3.  Type `Clean Code for Production` and press Enter.
4.  That's it! Your file is now clean and ready.
